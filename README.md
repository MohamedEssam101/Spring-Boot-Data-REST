# Spring-Boot-Data-REST
Spring Boot with Spring Data REST (with full database CRUD real-time project)

1) I am using Java 8
2) You Don't have to make any methods as Spring Data do all the work for you
3) You will have to change database credentials to yours  from ( src/main/resources/application.properties )
4) you will have to run the sql script in mysql 
5) use Postman or whatever you like to use  (get/put/delete)
